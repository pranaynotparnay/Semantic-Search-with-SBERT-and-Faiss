# Semantic-Search-with-SBERT-and-Faiss
This project aims to develop a semantic search system that retrieves relevant documents from a vast text corpus based on user queries. Unlike traditional keyword searches that might miss context, our goal is to use advanced NLP and deep learning techniques for a more accurate search experience.
Made a Naive UI to take the User Input and display the top-k results.
